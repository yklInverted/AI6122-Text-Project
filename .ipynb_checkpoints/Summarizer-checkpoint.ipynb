Why, then, would I risk making a mockery of myself by awarding it only three stars?  I\\'ll explain, and thereby attempt to justify this near condemnation of a world-renowned work -- a work, by the way, which Tolstoy himself says (in the Appendix) is NOT a novel, but which critics and the reading public in general call just that.  And so, rather than skirt controversy on this minor point, I will, too.\\n\\nAlthough I\\'d hesitate to call Tolstoy a stylist, there are (in over 1,200 pages of relatively small print) a number of instances in which he goes out on a literary limb.  One such is on p. 524:\\n\\n\"Nikolai set out after the first troika; behind him the rest came rattling and screeching.  At first they went at a slow trot along the narrow road.  As they drove past the garden, shadows from the bare trees often lay across the road and obscured the bright light of the moon, but as soon as they drove beyond the fence, a plain of snow, sparkling like diamonds, with a dove-blue sheen, bathed in moonlight and motionless, opened out on all sides.  Once, twice the front sleigh jolted over a bump; the next sleigh jolted in the same way, then the next, and, boldly breaking the frost-bound stillness, the sleighs strung out one after the other.\"\\n\\nWhile I realize that being in the least bit critical of Leo Tolstoy\\'s prose borders on iconoclasm, I nevertheless have to pose the question:  am I the only reader in Christendom who looks at this and wonders about certain punctuation, not to mention about the possibility of a run-on sentence or two in this otherwise lyrical passage--so atypical of Tolstoy both in WAR AND PEACE and in ANNA KARENINA (the only other work of his I\\'ve read and reviewed both here and at Goodreads)?\\n\\nI applaud Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, by the way, for an accurate translation (and transcription) of this work.  I believe that they -- much to their credit -- would not have corrected any of Tolstoy\\'s prose.  And so, I can only conclude that Tolstoy himself is to blame for any weakness or sloppiness in his work.  When I was a student of Russian language and literature at Columbia a few decades ago, Constance Garnett was considered the reigning queen in matters of English-language translations of the Russian classics.  To me at the time, her work frequently read more like that of a testosterone-spiked teenager out for a (drunken) Friday night spin.  Not so with Pevear and Volokhonsky, who are meticulously precise in their translation both of this work and of others (of both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky) I\\'ve read in the past.\\n\\nTolstoy is a first-rate story-teller, make no mistake about it.  And he paints a rather deplorable picture of both the Russian aristocracy of the time and of the singularly solipsistic, narcissistic and megalomaniac Napolen Bonaparte in particular.  But he\\'s simply sloppy in his prose, a fair portion of which is just NOT the handiwork of a brilliant and careful writer (e.g., Gustave Flaubert).\\n\\nWhile I don\\'t know that his generalized observations about the character and comportment of several European nationalities is a mark of genius, I DID find his descriptions of Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Italians and Russians (on p. 639) to be amusing, entertaining and -- let\\'s be frank -- damned accurate!\\n\\nAll of the above notwithstanding, I\\'ll give you that there are several passages in the novel (unfortunately, too lengthy to cite here in their entirety, but I\\'ll quote the first and last sentences of each) that are particularly well-crafted and that I\\'d describe as quintessentially Tolstoy.  The first begins at the bottom of p. 605 and concludes at the bottom of p. 606.\\n\\n\"Kings are the slaves of history ... Their every action, which to them seems willed by themselves, in the historical sense is not willed, but happens in connection with the whole course of history and has been destined from before all ages.\"\\n\\nA second comprises the entirety of Volume III, Part 2, Chapter 1 (pp. 682 - 682).\\n\\n\"Napoleon started the war with Russia because he could not help going to Dresden, could not help getting befuddled with honors, could not help putting on a Polish uniform, yielding to the heartening impression of a June morning, could not refrain from outbursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashov...Napoleon goes further, we retreat, and the very thing is achieved that was to defeat Napoleon.\"\\n\\nA third (Vol. III, Part 2, XXVII) begins on p. 783 and ends on p. 785:  \"Many historians say that the battle of Borodino...fulfilled his [Napoleon\\'s] role of seeming to command.\"\\n\\nA fourth (Vol. III, Part 3, I) begins on p. 821 and finishes up on p. 823:  \"For human reason, absolute continuity...their reflections on the occasion of those deeds.\"\\n\\nAnd then we have the Epilogue to WAR AND PEACE in which Tolstoy waxes quite philosophical (in Part 1, I-IV and the entire Part 2, which offers a lengthy monograph on freedom versus necessity) when he\\'s not sounding downright balzacien (Part 1, V-XVI).\\n\\nPrior to a most admirable Epilogue, however, we get the laconically poetic passage Pevear cites in his Introduction:  \"...drops dripped...whistled the saber, and again the horses scuffled and neighed...\" (p. 1,055).  Having once wrestled with my own metrical translation of Sergei Yesenin\\'s poem, \"A Letter to My Mother\" for inclusion in my novel, TROMPE-l\\'OEIL, I can certainly appreciate not only Tolstoy\\'s alliterative skill, but also Pevear\\'s equally alliterative and artful translation.\\n\\nBut what of Tolstoy\\'s -- overwrought, in my opinion -- metaphor on pp. 874-875, in which he compares the desertion of Moscow (just before the French invasion) with an abandoned beehive?  Where was his writer\\'s nose at THAT point?\\n\\nThese examples show not only the genius of the work, and of the man, but also its -- and his -- shortcomings.  I just don\\'t believe he was as good a writer (or at least an editor) as he was a thinker.  After all, every writer has the opportunity to edit and polish his own work, and no one\\'s pointing a gun at him to get on with the process.\\n\\nAnd so, given what we know about Tolstoy\\'s later years, I think the Latin citation (in footnote #9, on p. 1,237) is most appropriate -- and herewith, I\\'ll end my review except for one little piece of advice to you, a potential reader of WAR AND PEACE:\\n\\n\"Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\" *\\n\\nAnd the advice?  Do not try to read this book on the subway!  One or the other will find you dead on the tracks.\\n\\nRRB\\n01/14/14)\\nBrooklyn, NY\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Trompe-l-oeil-or-The-Old-In-and-Out-Of-Love/dp/B004OEKBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Trompe-l\\'oeil (or, The Old In and Out. Of Love.)</a>\\n\\n*  \"Those whom God wants to destroy, he first drives mad.\"', \"How does one do justice to a work as monumental and vast as Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' in the short space that Amazon grants? Indeed, I toyed with the idea of trying to encapsulate this epic work in 100 words, but failed. I believe there was one review of 'War and Peace' that was even shorter; it read:\\n'Napoleon invaded.\\nIt snowed.\\nNapolean failed.\\nRussia won.'\\nPerhaps that does encapsulate it. Tolstoy would have probably respected such as description, for, as verbose as he and other Russia novelists seemed to be (given a purely page-count analysis), he appreciated brevity and essentialism in the description.\\nThis holds true for 'War and Peace'. I was amazed at the lack of what one might hold to be extraneous detailing in the text -- I would have expected long, drawn out and tedious renderings of situations, emotions or events, but such is not the case.\\nIn Tolstoy's following of the Rostovs (poor country gentry) and the Bolkonskis (higher society), and a hero Pierre Bezuhkov, he illustrates basic truths in the way life is lived, and the way it ought to be lived. Tolstoy was a moralist, but no mystic in his writing. He felt it absolutely essential that the novelist should tell the truth, and mystical digressions lead away from that. His characters grow as we watch, and he recounts details that are important (such as Natasha and her doll as a child, and then later Natasha going to church -- these are two ages of the same person, to be sure, but not a simple updating of the character, as if an actress wearing a different costume).\\nEach circumstance, the day-to-day conversations and events, the family interactions, their dealing with life and success and death and defeat, all have an uncanny ring of truth about them. The family resemblance of characters leap off the page: the Rostovs all have a common element (beyond the basic social class attributes), and likewise there is and intangible similarity between Prince Andrei and his father.\\n'War and Peace' has been described as the Illiad and the Odyssey of the Russian people, with just cause. This is a work that speaks to the meaning and hope of life. His realism forced him to strip away much of the glorification of war and show the realities. Yet Tolstoy presents the events of 1812 as a moral crusade, and that the Russians won against the Napoleonic onslaught because of their adherence to simple, good and true virtues (as much as they relied on the snow to come to their defence). Even the upper classes, the urbane, wealthy and sophisticated Russians in 'War and Peace' have an underlying simplicity (contrasting to the French, and other foreigners', complexity and slyness) that gives them the moral upper hand.\\nOne almost hears the echo of Simple Gifts in this Russian epic:\\n'Tis a gift to be simple...'\\nYet this is not a stupid or ignorant simplicity. It is a wise state of being. One could imagine Tolstoy being at home with the philosophies of Emerson and Thoreau, and while he might sympathise with Thomas Carlyle in moral and political terms, he would be opposed to his historical hero-worshipful stance, preferring to think of the collective of humanity as the true agent and mover in history.\\n'War and Peace' is often held up as an example of a long book that nobody can read. This is rubbish. I have three editions, each of which is fewer than 1500 pages (yes, I know that is quite a lot), fewer pages than the Bible, fewer pages than some anthologies of modern novelists. It is long, there is no denying that. But it can be read, and I contend, given the right translation, one might become so enthralled that one might wish it were longer.\\nI commend to you the Greenwich House translation, by Rosemary Edmonds, which goes a long way toward simplfying the name game, and the Louise and Aylmer Maude translation, contained in the Britannica Great Books collection.\"], 'B004VN398C': ['The Vampire, the Witch, and the Werewolf spun an interesting tale of opposites attracting.

What will his family say ??  Romy\\'s ex is stalking and threatening, threw a brick and hit Romy, and FINALLY Romy presses charges.  The relationship with Romy and Brendan builds slowly, and it\\'s raw and incredible.  With the interesting story, hot M/M sexiness, and terrific characters you will be happy you read this one.  The ex gets well earned jail time, and the guys want to be together for the long haul.  I agree with another reviewer about Romy thinking Brendan will hurt him just because he beat up the ex after he was rescued.  Brendan never told anyone about the beat down, but word got out.  It is not fair of Romy to think Brendan is abusive, too, no way.  But then, I don\\'t have the abuse issues Romy had, so I don\\'t really know.  I\\'m glad they could settle that and move beyond.\\nHighly recommend this wonderful story.  ENJOY !!!!'], 'B00WVLRU86': [\"While I've loved all of this series I have to say this is my new fav!

Akron shows up so to speak in a variety of ways which was very fun and funny! Thanks for the fun Jackie and for those who haven't read this book buy and enjoy as I did!\"], 'B014N57K28': [\"Oh, how I love Rhys Fords writing! Shes top of the list for me when it comes to an author who is able to paint a picture with words. Add in those sexy Morgan men, stir with the hot band members who are their mates, and you have a win:win combination. Oh, and did I mention a little murder and a little chaos? This book would be number one on my wish list to give to friends this year.\\n\\nThis installment of the Sinners Gin series is about that mysterious Morgan weve heard of in past stories but never really got to meet until now. Quinn Morgan is everything I had hoped for and more. Hes tall, slender, sexy, studious, laid-back and the one Morgan who prefers not to be in the middle of the chaos also known as the Morgan family Sunday dinner.\\n\\nConnor Morgans long-time friend and adopted family member, Rafe Andrade, is finally back home where he belongs after a lengthy stint in a drug treatment center. Rafe destroyed everything he had built up in his life: his band, his relationship with his long-time bandmates, and his own reputation when he was found with a dead man in his apartment after a night of drinking, drugging, and debauchery. He has no idea what happened to cause the mans death but has taken on the burden of guilt, and he is struggling to find meaning and purpose in life now thats he back.\\n\\nHe doesnt really want much more than a chance to play his bass and a chance to take up where he left off with Quinn Morgan many years ago when he gave Quinn his first kiss. Of course, thats all he gave him at the time because Quinns big brothers would have killed him if he had taken liberties with their younger brother, a brother whom the family considers damaged. Just because Quinns mind doesnt work like the rest of them, and his perceptions and perspectives on the world seem to be totally off-the-wall sometimes is no reason, in Rafes opinion, for the family to treat Quinn as if hes deficient or defective.\\n\\nWhen Rafe and Quinn get together this time, theres more than a brief kiss involved as the two pick up where they left off years before, and they realize they are perfect for each other, accepting each other just the way they are. Then Quinn gets a chance to audition before a reluctant Damian, Mick, and Forest to see if he can fit into their band as the bassist theyve been searching for, and his hope for a future with both Quinn and music in his life might become a reality. Unfortunately, just as he starts to gain confidence and look forward to the future, it becomes evident that someone is out to hurt Quinn and may destroy their chance to be together before they can make their dreams a reality.\\n\\nAs I said at the beginning of this review, I loved this story, and I highly recommend this book. If you are a lover of M/M romance, and if you love mysteries or stories about musicians, this one will be perfect for you. Since theres so much overlap with the other stories in the series, I would also recommend that you read those books first.

In this daring story, we become more familiar with Jocelyn\\'s plight to understand her deepest and darkest sexual desires. In the previous book, \"Unveiling Facade\" we are introduced to the incredible, lust-filled Mansion by Jocelyn\\'s best friend, Beth. Left wondering what would become of Jocelyn, we find that she has blossomed into a well sought after Hostess at the Mansion. She seems to be happier than she\\'s ever, been and relishing in her most reeling erotic fantasies.\\n\\nUnexpectedly, Jocelyn is thrown to the wolves as a dark blast from her past returns to humiliate her in ways she could never expect. She is mentally broken down, and forced to question her purpose and self-worth. Not only had her life changed, Jocelyn had become a prisoner with no way out. Her body was not her own any longer. During her suppression however, Jocelyn meets her unlikely savior, and unlocks a new door to her inner desires. With her new outlook, Jocelyn is given the jolt that she needs to overcome her stigmas, and to use the darkness within herself to break the chains holding her back. Will she prevail in honing her new sexually charged attributes to expand her worth in the business? Or, will she be forced to live out her days under the scrutiny of her past? One thing is for sure, Jocelyn has a new calling, and she\\'s not afraid to use it.\\n\\nThis psychological, sexually fueled feast will have you begging for book three only a chapter into the story!

Even though the book is marked as new adult, I feel like it read more like a young adult novel. The main character is 18 years old, so she is borderline between the two genres but the maturity level of the characters pushed it, in my opinion anyway, towards the younger young adult side of the spectrum. Speaking of immature characters, I almost put this book down (DNF) three times within the first 30%. One time at only 6%, which would make it the quickest I had ever put a book down and didn't pick it up again. But I decided to give it another chance, and then I decided to give it another chance. And the third time I stuck with it. And while Dancing in the Athenian Rain was no where close to my favorite book ever, it did make an impressive recovery in my opinion. Dancing in the Athenian Rain is a book that gets so, so much better as it goes on. The second half of the book is very good, so good that it made up for the less than impressive beginning. What I am trying to say is, if you are like me, and you find yourself not enjoying the first part of the book (and I will tell you my problem with the beginning) push through it if the premise interests you, because once Donna gets to Greece, the book completely changes. In a great way.\\n\\nI love the idea behind Dancing in the Athenian Rain. A girl that is not understood in her time, goes back to ancient Greece and she is able to come into her true self. Watching Donna gain confidence and start to love herself was my favorite part of the story. She starts the book out with no self appreciation at all. It was sad really. The people around her were so unbelievably awful (no, really, they were unbelievable) that they had convinced her that she was totally worthless. Part of the problem was herself. She shouldn't have allowed them to influence her opinion of herself that drastically, but it has to be hard with such negativity around you all the time. She should have ditched them one page one. Her so called best friend and boyfriend were so awful. They were the reason that I wanted to DNF. They didn't even seem like plausible real people to me because they were so beyond horrible. Why on earth was she friends with those people? But that is besides the point, because they are not in a majority of the book. (which is why I encourage you to continue on with the story if they are what annoys you.)\\n\\nOnce Donna gets to Greece the whole mood and tempo of the story changes. Even the writing seemed to change. There was a sophistication and maturity in Donna in Greece that was not present in the modern day Donna. I liked her a whole lot more. She did take a while to grow on me, but my fondest for her got there as the book went on. I loved author Katie Hamstead's depiction of Ancient Greece. She wove bits of history throughout the story and they worked well. There were lots of twists up her sleeve too that took me by surprise. Some were more surprising than others, that's for sure.\\n\\nBottom line: if you are a fan of time young adult travel romances and of stories of ancient Greece, Dancing in the Athenian Rain is a book you should consider checking out. I had some major problems with the beginning, but once I pushed through them and the setting changed to Ancient Greece, I liked the story a whole lot more. Donna has some truly awful friends, but if you are able to push past them and write them off as terrible people, you will enjoy the story a lot more.\\n\\n*Disclaimer- I got a copy of this book for free in exchange for my honest review.

Enter Marie, a striking young woman  and the first new individual to be cloned in a long time.  Floyd 5.136 is certainly a bit different from the usual sci-fi fare.  The author Chapman has taken a great deal of pains to give his characters dimension and feelings, not easily done, especially in this particular genre and while the concept of cloning is hardly new, the author puts a decidedly fresh spin on it, making for a solid read.  However, if there is something negative to be said about Floyd 5.136, it would have to be the beginning of the book, which could have been better rounded in order to better set up both the characters and the story line.  Each genre has its own set of challenges and sci-fi is certainly no different.  In science fiction, an author creates their own unique universe, expecting that his or her readers will buy into their universe.  However, thats only possible when that universe is fully articulated from the very beginning so that the readers can not only picture it in their minds but actually inhabit that alternate universe.

The whole story felt rushed, considering it all takes place in about 2 weeks, from accident to hospital stay to therapy to ending engagement with the lousy fianc. Also for being a 308 page (per Amazon) story with a preview of a few chapters from the next book to end in a cliff hanger was totally frustrating. I also felt the story was very repetitive, constantly going over the same stuff, from repeating stuff from one parent to the other, to medical diagnosis', conversations, etc.\\n\\nThe whole medical thing was wrong to me. Katie would have been in intensive care (ICU) until she came out of the coma, they have strict visiting hours in the ICU, not letting anyone spending the night -let alone 3 people. When my daughter had her baby recently, they didn't even let her husband spend the night! I felt that the whole medical thing was rushed. No way after her injuries & emergency care (drilling multiple holes into her skull to relieve pressure) would they release her home 2-3 days after the accident or 1-2 days after waking up from a coma or what ever the story wants to call it.

We also meet Dick (Cheney), a very handsome, roguish, swaggering man who is anything but good for her.  But Dick is determined to win the affections of Andrea (and he really needs a date for a big shin-dig coming up soon).  Dick also happens to be pretty wise and he knows that to win Andrea, he has to be persistent but also wary of some of the damage that\\'s been done to her by previous lovers.\\n\\nOh...and Dick happens to be a vampire as well.\\n\\nI found this to be a quick and entertaining read.  Mostly light fare, but with enough here to keep me interested.  It also definitely has me curious and interested in reading more of this world and I look forward to searching out more of Molly Harper\\'s books (specifically those in the Half-Moon Hollow series).\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that the main character\\'s name is Dick Cheney.  I have to admit to having a difficult time picturing anyone other than the former Vice-President of the United States when I read that name, no matter how much Harper tells us what she imagines he looks like.  Sometimes this can\\'t be helped, sometimes this is done on purpose, but for whatever reason, I am one of those people who can\\'t shake the imagine of the more famous namesake.

No instructions, no supervision, no nothing.\\n\\nWhat happened next is the story, indeed, the miracle, of this book, and it will blow you away. Suffice it to say that the teacher quickly discovered that kids from desperately poor slums, badly educated, could, WITHOUT INSTRUCTION, figure out a great deal about computers and how to use them on their own.

Between Ellies penchant for closing people out and her quick to anger nature, and Flynns need for routine and predictability to combat his Aspergers, a relationship between these two is not an easy prospect as seemed to be implied at the end of their first book.\\n\\nNow that Ellie is finished with college, she returns to Wellston, West Virginia where Flynn is waiting. But there are not many happy memories for Ellie in Wellston, and as she struggles to find a job and feel like she is moving forward with her life, she fights the ghosts of her past that seem to be around every corner.

The simple yet descriptive manner used by Ms. Blair was perfect against the backdrop of a good man with a cowboy\\'s heart.\\n\\nThe Really-NOT-Bad: Was there really any \\'bad\\'? I liked the way Ms, Blain mixed private time for Sarah and Kit and group time spent with the background characters. The secondary characters were depicted well enough that I was able to develop feelings about them as well as our hero and heroine. Due to the way Sarah and Kit\\'s relationship was arranged, I truly could not see how there could be a happy ending and that made me sad. That just goes to show you how well written and developed these characters are. As is often the case, I began reading late in the evening and intended to stop part way through the book and finish it the next day. Could. Not. Do. It. I had to know. I had to see it through, even if the end was not what I wanted it to be.\\n\\nThe Snuggly: This was a story that started out being about fun and carefree time spent together by a couple with spontaneous chemistry. The Snuggly could have been really hot and heavy and descriptive, which has it\\'s place. However, what developed was a wonderful romantic relationship, making their intimacy loving and tender and sensual. There was enough description that you were well aware of what took place without feeling awkward reading this out loud to, say, your Mother. There was great kissing and lots of snuggling and I loved every minute of it.\\n\\nThe Rest: This was a fantastic happy and heartfelt romance. It was all about a change from the usual for both the hero and heroine and living in the moment, something I am trying to do more of. Being instead of always Doing. This book is a fantastic way to begin the New Year\\'s Eve Club series because it really makes you want more. As it is, I cannot wait to read the three I have not yet read. I would absolutely recommend reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sarah-s-Cowboy-The-New-Year-s-Eve-Club/dp/B00BLO145E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sarah\\'s Cowboy (The New Year\\'s Eve Club)</a>&nbsp;to anyone who wants a contemporary loving romance.

It was a little predictable but that was ok.  Sometimes we need predictability and a happy ending.'], 'B00N0Y5WV0': [\"Imagine summer camp for adults, only its not summer and they aren't chaperoned. I wanted to join them. Maggie is adorable. Shot down once in the love department, she carries the baggage with her. It affects her confidence with men and how she interacts with them romantically, or rather doesnt.  Once she found a man worthy of getting into, her confidence skyrocketed.\\n\\nRandy is messed up yet loveable, until he does a few not so nice things, which made both me and Maggie want to pull his (not our) hair out. A wonderful, handsome, real, and down to earth character. I could have done without one of his little habits though.\\nI was shocked at the sex scene (that is not a spoiler).

I was not compensated in any way.\\n\\nI loved how this author made her to be a woman who is less than perfect.  Its something that most people will not admit to but it does make her a little more human (kinda-sorta).  Our author also makes this a fun tale to read  it will have you laughing (you just will not be able to help yourself).  Some of you may be a little disappointed with the lack of sex but there are enough teasers that you can use your imagination to fill in the missing pieces - I certainly didn't miss it.  And if those scenes were added it might have extended the book so I find it was perfect just the way it was written.  This is a contemporary paranormal that shouldnt be missed.\"], 'B00AMOOE0Q': ['This would have been a 5 star but there were too many errors that should have been caught by the editor, proofreader, etc.  Aunt Nancy became Aunt Mary and then back to Aunt Nancy.  There were also words omitted, etc.'], 'B009HLO0ZY': [\"The mystery would be a short story. But steamy scenes made the book into a much longer read. If you don't want sexy skip this one.  I liked the book, steamy and all.\"], 'B017A11MSU': ['I found a recommendation for this book on Reddit, of all places -- the person posting about it declared that it was not just a funny book for its time period, but it remained funny over a century later.  I\\'m always in the mood for a funny read, and I\\'m not one to turn my nose up at a book simply because it was written a long time ago.  A quick search on Amazon showed that, being a public-domain title, it was free to download to my Kindle... and though the Kindle version of the book has a few formatting issues and some parts of the book haven\\'t aged terribly well, the vast majority of the book is still quite funny and entertaining, a sort of proto-Bill Bryson tale that should appeal to fans of British humor and/or travel literature.\\n\\n\"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\" follows the author, his two friends Harris and George, and a tagalong fox terrier named Montmorency as they plan a boating holiday along the Thames river.  They anticipate a leisurely time taking in the sights of the river, camping out, and enjoying the fresh air.  What they get instead is unexpected comedy as they struggle with their uncooperative boat, bicker with one another, and have unexpected run-ins with colorful characters along the way.  And while the author occasionally pauses to wax poetic about the scenery and the history of the land they pass through, he\\'s also not above recalling some disastrously hilarious anecdotes... or poking fun at his companions and himself along the way.\\n\\nWhile some of the content of this book might be slightly dated nowadays, there\\'s plenty of humor to be had that\\'s fresh and relatable today.  Many can relate to some of the comic bits of this book -- going to a party to find someone necking in every corner, a singer who\\'s utterly ignorant of their own terrible singing skills, and dogs that look adorably innocent but are secretly troublemakers at their furry hearts.  There\\'s even a section where the author reads a medical text and convinces himself he has nearly every disease in the book -- the 19th-century equivalent of \"Googling your symptoms.\"  And there\\'s an unexpectedly prophetic bit where the author wonders if the boring everyday objects of their age will become priceless collectibles to people in the year 2000...\\n\\nThe story does wander a fair bit, and the author quite often pauses in recounting their journey to bring up some event prior to the story.  I forgive most of these asides because they\\'re hilarious, but some people might not appreciate the frequent deviations from the plot.\\n\\nAs for the characters of this book... if George and Harris are based on real people, it\\'s a wonder they made it down and up the river in one piece.  I\\'m sure many of their flaws are exaggerated for comedy purposes, but they can be so inept and lazy that it\\'s hilarious.  These are characters that would be right at home in a Monty Python sketch... which is perhaps the point.\\n\\nA word on this particular Kindle edition -- it appears as if it originally contained pictures, but said pictures were cut out, leaving their captions behind.  This is a little annoying, but it doesn\\'t ruin the book for me.  Just a warning, however, to other readers...\\n\\nA delightfully funny read that remains fresh and relevant even a hundred years later, \"Three Men in a Boat\" was just as good as Reddit claimed, and great for anyone who needs a good laugh.  Who says that classic literature has to be stuffy, slow, and boring anyhow?'], 'B004LLIGNM': ['Great chick lit book! Kept my attention and had a hard time putting it down. Well developed characters and story line. Had me guessing how it would end. Glad it was a good one!'], 'B00K4LDB0Q': [\"As usual I'm hooked on a series. Love the characters and story!

This covers sleep for infants, but also talks about sleep issues for older children too.\\n\\nTopics such as pacifiers, co-sleeping, getting dads involved, colic, security blankets, teething, naps, SIDS, nightmares, bedwetting, sleepwalking, hyperactivity, self-soothing, disruptions to the family schedule, illnesses, allergies and more are all covered, with an emphasis upon using the tips, but in ways that fit with your family and schedule.\\n\\nThis is one of those 'must-have' books for every parent's bookshelf. This would make a great gift to new parents and a handy reference guide throughout the child's development. This book has a very comforting, encouraging tone that is sure to reassure new parents.\"], 'B00IHG5Y7S': [\"I really enjoyed In a field of Oranges, written by Kristen James. This book touched my heart. I ran thru all my emotions from being angry, feeling sad, happy and crying.  I loved the main characters Sierra and Lance. My heart just ached for them and all they had been thru. Lance had served in Afghanistan and brought home many horrors. Sierra, a psychiatrist  who specialized in helping these returning soldiers had a few demons of her own. After Sierra's brother was killed in action Lance brought her a letter her brother had written to her. This is a sweet story how Lance and Sierra helped each other fight their demons. I will be recommending this book to all my friends. This is the second book that I have read from this author. I loved them both.
