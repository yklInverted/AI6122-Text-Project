       "'This is a truly wonderful display of musical innovation & inspiration. Rickey Wright, in his so called review of this album, stated that it wasn\\'t a \"concept\" album.  Nonsense!  Earth, Wind & Fire were a concept band in and of themselves, every one of their albums from the decade of the 70\\'s had 2 main concepts, Oneness & African Pride!  They understood the rich and unprecedented history of the African people worldwide and brought this knowledge in mystical terms to the masses.Like all great prophets before, Maurice White in particular & the Elements as a whole, spoke in parables and those with eyes to see and ears to hear were amazed and electrified at what was being revealed!  Their lyrical content was second to none and greatly under appreciated by \"so called critics\" like Rickey Wright. This album is one of the finest expressions of musical & lyrical genius as you\\'ll find.\"Serpentine Fire\"- Pure power and mysticism, a song about the rising of the coiled, serpentine energy up the spine & through the Chakra\\'s till it reaches the crown & enlightenment occurs!  Who truly understood the power and magic of this song with it\\'s unmatched lyrics and hard funk influenced rhythms.  Those who study ancient eastern religions will understand this one totally.\"Fantasy\"- One of the hits off of this album that you hear all over FM radio & has been featured in a miriad of soundtracks to films. Beautiful piano intro that precludes some of the most astonishing strings & horns you\\'ll ever here.  Lyrically, another masterpiece which those who\\'ve studied eastern religions will get without any problem.  The hints it gives about reincarnation and other brothers and sisters from other worlds shows Maurice\\'s lyrical mastery.\"Jupiter\"- This is the song were the Phenix Horns get a chance to show off their other worldly talent with a blazing intro that burns throughout the entire song.  Great bass guitar work here by Verdine \"the Fire\" White as well.\"Love\\'s Holiday\"- After a short interlude, then comes this beautiful ballad by Maurice White.  Pure poetry here as a lover asks the object of his affections, \"Would you mind, if I touched if i kissed if i held you tight till the morning light\"! Maurice\\'s gorgeous tenor shines in this song which ends with a nasty funk laced guitar solo by Johnnie Graham.  One of the true highlights of the album.\"Brazillian Rhyme\"- This is probably their most famous \"interlude\" ever.  It showcases the groups unparalled vocal harmonies with Phillip Bailey\\'s falsetto leading the way!  Great Keyboard by Larry Dunn and Verdine tears it up on the bass!!\"I\\'ll write a Song for You\"- This may be my personal favorite on the album. Beautiful song written by Phillip and Al McKay, this song is both a love ballad & a mystical adventure.  Pure poetry in motion about a lover describing his undeniable devotion to his soulmate. Stunning acoustic guitar by McKay & Graham on this one with lush orchestrations & the Elements outstanding melodies and vocal harmonies.\"Magic Mind\"- This is a pure funk tour de force!!  Great keyboards, horns, bass and nasty rhythm guitar work.  Lyrics are tremendous with lots hidden messages along the way.\"Runnin\"- This is the instrumental selection that has everything you\\'d expect for Earth, Wind & Fire!  For those who have the double LP \"Gratitude\", this will remind you somewhat of the jam \"New World Symphony\".  Great movements and progressions throughout the song with nasty trumpet & sax solos by the Phenix Horns!\"Be Ever Wonderful\"- After the most gorgeous intro i\\'ve ever heard (the longer version on their box set is other worldly) comes this song.  It has a pure gospel feel to it with simple yet profound lyrics and incredible vocals, horns!  This song builds to an absolute flurry of brilliance at the end with the vocals soaring to places that just having never been reached before!This group was able to bring together many elements from Jazz, Funk, R&B;, Rock, Latin & Classical musical influences and merge them together into a sound that was not then nor has it since been duplicated.  They truly were the Elements of the Universe and the Greatest Band of all time!'"

       "\"Norah Jones basically embodies everything that is wrong with the world these days when it comes down to music. She proves that selling massive amounts of albums and getting loaded with all kinds of dubious music-awards really doesn't have anything to do with any form of musical ability, or creativity for that matter. Just like her first album, this one is also filled with drowsy, monotonous bores that should pass as 'jazzy' but calling this music jazz is a terrible insult to the genre that gave us Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Andrew Hill, McCoy Tyner, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Charles Mingus, and many more. 'That's not to say that this music is 'inoffensive'. For most people it IS inoffensive, just pleasant musical wallpaper that doesn't disturb a family dinner or an half an hour of washing the dishes, which declares the ridiculous amount of sales. For me, and thankfully many others who appreciate good music, this music IS offensive. It's mindnumbingly bland easy listening that doesn't even deserve to be labeled as music, but is seen as such, which is an insult. Yes, every song sounds exactly the same as the song before, so why do people spend their hard-earned money on this drivel? It really has some kind of brainwash-effect: after an hour of Norah Jones' easy listening-horror, you'll likely feel like all the blood is sucked right out of your body. If they're looking for something that's inoffensive yet beautiful, why not check out the pianoworks of Satie, or a collection of gorgeous jazz-ballads by Sarah Vaughan? Why does music without a heart and a soul always win from music that IS a product of love and devotion for music? Why does a talentless, lethargic and whining puppet like Norah Jones get tons of airplay for her elevator-music taken to the extreme, and is all the good music pushed to the side? Like I said; just what is wrong with the world these days. I gave up all hope that one day, popularity will be reserved for those musicians who challenge, touch and amaze us with beautiful, exciting music. I personally try not to care and will keep on discovering all the musical gems that the world -thankfully- still has to offer. As for Norah Jones; I'd rather listen to pigs being slaughtered for a full hour than to hear that cursed 'Don't Know Why' for the 6th billionth time. Because I'm so unfortunate that my dad digs her. Spare yourself: avoid at all costs.\""
