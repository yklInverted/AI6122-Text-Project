M. RULES!', 'I JUST SAW THEM IN CONCERT AND--WOW WOW WOW!)', 'in partnership with one of our greatest American musicians.This album is real.', 'It is at once raw and refined, traditional and modern.', 'Rather than emphasizing the suffering and rage of the black South African people at the time (which perhaps Simon could not have and was not in the place to convey authentically) it becomes an exuberant celebration of their rich and vivacious musical culture.', 'Everyone benefits from \"Graceland\" and the ethno-musical boundaries that it has opened and exposed.', \"For me, this album marks a turning point in Paul Simon's career, a point at which he broke out of the folk-rock that society expected and blossomed to a whole new level of intense and brilliant musicality.What's actually on the album?\", 'I planned on keeping this review concise, but I fear that goal has gone out the window.', 'It is impossible to write about the \"highlights from \\'Graceland,\\'\" because all of the songs on here are fantastic and distinctive.', '\"The Boy in the Bubble\" is dark and forceful, with fascinating lyrics and a strong tune.', 'It immediately illustrates the perfect blending of American and South African musical styles-take some time to really listen to all the elements of this song.', '\"Graceland\" is equally moving, but with a somewhat lighter feel.', 'All of the songs are truly impossible to describe in words with any justice, and so I will simply say that Graceland is totally unique.', 'It is touching and catchy and sad and joyous and exciting and tired and funny.', '\"I Know What I Know\" is possibly my favorite song on the album.', 'It sounds very South African, but also very universally vivacious.', \"The words are simple but meaningful, and it is Simon's unassuming but powerful vocals and the amazing background vocals that truly complete the song.\", '\"Gumboots\" is another fun yet serious song that moves wonderfully, and \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\" is similarly vivacious yet as wonderfully distinct as any song on this album.', '(I would love to describe them in greater detail, but that could get dangerously long, and besides, listening is the only way to do justice to the songs.)', '\"Call Me Al\" is a song I have come to adore in so many different respects-like most of the songs on this album it sounds lighthearted enough, but is also meaningful and musically outstanding.', 'I just love how the words sound on this song.', '\"Under African Skies\" is a beautiful and versatile duet, with a strong and exhilarating chorus.', '\"Homeless\" is the most striking example of Ladysmith\\'s essential contribution to this album, an inspiring and distinctive blending of voices.', 'It is a beautiful example of the partnership of \"Graceland\"-Simon is not in any way copying South African music, but is rather becoming a part of it, working alongside Ladysmith to create authentic masterpieces.', '\"That Was Your Mother\" has a Cajun element to it that is remarkably complimentary to the South African elements, and so it feels right on the album.', 'It is upbeat and fun, but interesting at the same time.', 'Perhaps it seems a leap from the clear South African influences on the rest of the album, but Simon pulls it off.', '\"Crazy Love\" and \"All Around the World\" feel similar to me, both have a strong background and alternating lively choruses and (slightly) more pensive verses.', 'Again, they are simply great songs, blending American music and that of South Africa.Clearly, I love this album.', \"It's truly inspired, and inspiring, full of sheer human energy and an amazingly unique yet authentic blend of cultures and music.\", 'There is no low-point, no song that you would skip over-each one is fascinatingly different and exiting yet they form an extremely unified album.', '\"Graceland\" is a timeless album, a true highlight in global music.', \"Who'd have though that my favorite album of all time would be from the '80s?!\", \"Words cannot describe the innovation and musical and cultural insight in this album-you've got to experience it for yourself.\", 'Hailed as a pinnacle of Paul Simon career, this 1986 album combined his stellar songwriting with influences of South African music.', 'It won scores of Grammies and also in the recent Rolling Stone poll placed in the Top 100 of best albums in rock&amp;roll history.Grooves and hooks are played by such improbable instruments as accordion (witness the fantastic opener, &quot;The Boy In The Bubble&quot;) and human voices (female choir on &quot;I Know What I Know&quot;).', 'The unique vocal group Ladysmith Blackmambazo lends a gentle Zulu stamp on, for instance, the charming &quot;Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes&quot; and Linda Ronstadt offers tender guest vocals on &quot;Under African Skies&quot;.', 'Video fans will certainly remember the clip to &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot;, featuring Chevy Chase.', 'The classic title track has a reference to American South, including Elvis and Mississippi delta, which highlights Simon as not focusing solely on one source of inspiration.', '&quot;Gumboots&quot; is the tune that kicked off the whole project.', \"In fact, just the final two tracks have the bar dropped slightly from otherwise a jaw-dropping quality of the album, boasting also intellectually challenging, yet poetic, lyrics.Carrying a significant socio-political accent -- at the time of release South Africa was still in the throes of institutionalised apartheid and as such boycotted by the world -- &quot;Graceland&quot; is a fabulous piece of 1980's culture and belongs to the cream the pop music has to offer.\", 'It will remain timeless.', 'Consider buying it?', \"Don't hesitate.\"], 'B0002ZDW80': ['This is the bottom line: If you like New-Wave/Electronic music of the early eighties and you had no idea who A Flock Of Seagulls were or had no way of associating them with the way they looked or their MTV status, then you would like this album.', \"A very undderrated band for sure, this album is awesome especially for (It's Not Me) Talking, Wishing, Nightmares, and The Traveller.\", \"I'll admit the bonus B-Sides arent the greatest but the live version of I Ran is excellent and the orginal album holds up very well.\", 'I dont think its my absolute favorite but it ties with their first album( DNA and Messages are two of my favs).', 'The guitar and keyboard sound so good together it really creates a timeless feel, even for a New Wave band.', 'This album speaks for itsself(and its era).', 'Do as the album title implies...good cd.', 'Nuff said'], 'B0000DD79B': ['Great, just what we need.', 'A 2-album disc set that features the overrated, introspective music of two of the most annoying hippies alive.', \"Didn't these guys break up because one was jealous that the other guy had hair?\", \"In any case, I've heard almost all these songs and they're about as boring as all get-out.\", \"The only tune worth anything is &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; and even that got overplayed to death by commercial radio.I'm telling you, if you want to discover true hippie music, check out Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead or Bon Jovi.\", 'At least all those hippies managed to rock out at times!!', 'These guys just strum their acoustic guitars like stoned losers - which they are!', '!What can I say?', \"If you're a hippie, run, don't walk, to discover these &quot;masterful&quot; songs.\", 'Hey, you might &quot;dig&quot; it, man.', 'Otherwise, steer far

Bird'' for the very first time, I instantly took a dislike for it.\", 'Her voice and the simplistic lyrics pulled me off the song.', 'I completely dismissed her as a MTV darling and never purchase her debut album.', \"The other single releases from ''Whoa Nelly'' did peak my curiosity though Nelly Furtado didn't manage to keep my attention.\", \"However a gem named ''Powerless (Say What You Want)

the one-and-only Henry Rollins to do all of the spoken-word stuff is truly inspired casting.As for the rest of the album, which is *drastically* altered by Coyne & company from the Floyd

      "Erykah has done it once again.Her studio sophomore but actual third album is a good or even better than her last two.She has really matured and has used \"cleva\" lyrics in her songs.I love that fact that all of her tracks run into her each other.I could care less if the track listing does not match what's on the cd.Be happy with what she has givin' you.Here's a breakdown:1.Penitentiary Philosophy-A rock track that demonstrates Erykah's maturity with her music.At first, this may shock fans that are used to Erykah's jazz soundin' songs.After the first listen, you will be hooked2.Didn't Cha Know-The more traditional Erykah sound is back at track 02.She sounds exceptional on this song.She wonders if she \"made a wrong turn back there somewhere.\"3.My Life-The beat is hot.Seems like many rap artists borrowed samples from her beats.Her life is not easy but she still manages to survive.There's \"no turnin' back.\"4.... & On-The remix of On & On.I love this song.It's really a song for the haters of Erykah.\"What good do your words do if they don't understand you.Don't go talkin' that $h*t, Badu, Badu\".5.Cleva-This song is one word that describes Erykah.The one phrase I love in this song is \"my dress cost nothin' but seven dollars but I made it fly.\"6.Hey Sugah-An interlude between tracks and a transition moment in her album or as an intro to track 07.7.Booty-The beat is just amazing.I love her lyrics.All of them make me laugh everytime I hear them.\"You got sugah on your peter but yo' ni**a thinks I'm sweeta, but I don't want him.\"8.Kiss Me On My Neck (Hesi)-I can relate.\"Use me, don't abuse me.\"I can stand that you gonna use me sometimes, but don't take advantage of it.9.A.D. 2000-This song makes me sad sometimes.The content is strong here.She talks about delapadated buildings and that her name will be misstated.If didn't guess already, it's referring to the future.10.Orange Moon-A lovely ballad.She is the moon and she reflects the light of her \"sun\".You get it, it's a pun!Well, if you don't then I ain't got nothin' to say to you.11.In Love With You-A lovely ballad with Marley.I have to listen to this song everytime I listen to this cd.12.Bag Lady-This isn't that overplayed radio remix.This is the mellow, laid back version that emphasizes on her words not the music.I love the fact that repeats the phrase \"pack light\".I think this song is sayin' don't carry extra package if you don't need to (stop talkin about past relationships and go on with your life).You may think that this song has a different meaning.13.Time's A Wastin-This song speaks to me.There's always time wastin' if you don't take your time, as she says throughout the song.Don't rush yourself, otherwise you're wastin' time.14.Green Eyes-WOW!A 10min song I would actually listen to.The first part sounds like an old time record of her sayin' \"my eyes are green because I eat a lot of vegetables.\"If yall don't know what green eyes means, it means that you have hate or jealousy in your heart.Also, this song is the breakup song from the guy from Outkast.The song continues into two more beat changes.With each beat change, the words in the song change but the same message still comes across.15.Bag Lady (Cheeba Sac Radio Edit)-This is the version that most of yall are familiar with.This version isn't available on the US Retail.Erykah has three hit albums, that's rare.Even with Baduizm and Live being made in 1997, I still keep them in my cd player with Aaliyah.Erykah has real talent, and does not have a studio voice.She is authentic and not that buggle-gum stuff that others try to sing.The import is worth the extra money!\n"

The content is strong here. She talks about delapadated buildings and that her name will be misstated. Orange Moon-A lovely ballad. You get it, it's a pun! In Love With You-A lovely ballad with Marley. Green Eyes-WOW! She is authentic and not that buggle-gum stuff that others try to sing. The import is worth the extra money!\n"
