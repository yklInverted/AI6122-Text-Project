      "I absolutely LOVED that Monica decided to write this novella for Drew and Fable!It was absolute perfection you guys.Seriously.I love these two so much and after everything they've both endured, they deserve to have their happiness.It hasn't been an easy road and we really see that here.These two have had to fight for their future together and watching them earn their HEA is nothing short of beautiful.&#34;We came together, he ran away, and then we faced our fears.Together.When you struggle for something so good, so right, you cherish it more.You hold it close, nurture it, protect it, make sure you never, ever let your guard down.That's how I feel about my almost husband.&#34; (e-ARC 10%)Fable and Drew now have the pressures of Drew's NFL career to consider.Fable, while a feisty, strong character, has her insecurities.She is afraid of all the what ifs- what if Drew finds someone better while he's away?What if she's not really the one for him?What if she can't handle the distance?I can't fault her for thinking this way.We all know Drew is one fine specimen, but let's not forget the utter love he has for her.Case in point:&#34;This woman is just ******* it for me.She's no longer a girl anymore.The jaded, angry, and defiant girl who was so determined to fight the world is gone, though shade of her still shine through.I loved that girl.Fiercely.And I love the woman she is now, just as fiercely.She's my fianc&eacute;e, my future wife, the future mother of my children.Fable is the woman who will always stand by my side.Forever.&#34; (e-ARC 9%)Holy heck, really?Drew Callahan is the real effing deal folks.He has been through some rough stuff, but he has emerged victorious.He has worked to rebuild his relationship with his father and has formed a pretty special one with Fable's younger brother, Owen.I like that Owen looks up to Drew, because Drew really is a great role model for him.I'm looking forward to seeing how Drew and Fable have shaped Owen in his story Four Years Later.Drew and Fable have their share of challenges to face as a married couple as well as with Drew's high profile job as QB for the SF 49'ers, but these two are rock solid in their love for one another and will be able to weather any storm that comes at them.\n"
